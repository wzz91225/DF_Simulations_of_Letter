| Keypoint | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Simulation Software | MATLAB R2023a, including DSP System Toolbox, Filter Design HDL Coder, Fixed-Point Designer, Mapping Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Parallel Computing Toolbox. |
| Simulation Computer | PC 1: Intel Core i7-7820HK, 32 GB Memory, Windows 10; PC 2: Intel Core i7-13700K, 64 GB Memory, Windows 11; Compute Server: AMD EPYC 7643, 640 GB Memory, Windows Server 2019. |
| Numerical Algorithm | Plain numerical simulations. |
| Noise Source | Gaussian noise generated by randn(). |
| Simulation Time | The range is from a few hours to dozens of hours depends on performance of computer. |
| Computational Effort  | Mainly depends on Number of azimuth angles * Number of simulation variables * Number of simulations * Sampling rate of the receiver / Frequency of the signal / Velocity of the receiver. |
| Algorithm Accuracy | Mainly depends on SNR, Sampling rate of the receiver / Frequency of the signal, Cycle of signal sampled, Relative distance * Frequency of the signal. |
| Memory Requirements | Mainly depends on the process number of parallel computing. Each process requires approximately 1 GB of memory. |
| Simulation Variables | SNR (Signal-to-noise Ratio), SR (Sampling rate of the receiver), CIC (Cycle of signal sampled), Dist (Relative distance), Freq (Frequency of the signal), CIN (Number of coherent integration). |
